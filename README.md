# Coin run short challenge

![](thumbnail.gif)

This is a solution with pretty logs for the Clash of Code [Coin run][1]. Hence,
credit goes to [UnicornP][2].

Before taking a look at the solution I strongly suggest you to
[try it yourself][3]!

And if you want to try it on your own computer, you can run the tests with:

```bash
./test # run all the tests with minimal output
VERBOSE=1 ./test # Verbose.
./test 1 2 # Run selected tests.
SOLUTION=./solution.py ./test # Try your solution
```

And share your solution in any language afterward!

You could also add some constraints, change output. Feel free to play with that
code.
